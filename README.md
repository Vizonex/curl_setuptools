# Curl Setuptools
An Extension that installs and compiles curl into a Python Extension weather that be for Cython or CPython.
This tool aims at making the hardest task (compiling curl) a bit easier and less frustrating
this will attempt to put an end to any intallation and compilation issues with Zlib, Openssl, Curl and NGHttp2 once and for all.

## Current Todos
- [x] Curl Installer
- [x] NGhttp2 Installer
- [ ] Openssl Installer
- [ ] Zlib Installer

- [ ] Zlib Compiler
- [ ] Curl Compiler (Pending...)
- [ ] NGHttp2 Compiler
- [ ] Openssl Compiler (this one is going to be a pain because you have to go out and get the nasm compiler, strawberry pearl as well which is another diskspace-eater)
      It can burn your computer like a microwave if your using a lower level OS.
